Today is my first day at The Banff Centre. For the next two weeks I will be
here on a [self-directed residency in the Film & Media department](http://www.banffcentre.ca/film-media/self-directed/).

I'm here to spend time away from the distractions of New York City and to focus on a couple of projects. My goal is to advance a project to the point where it can be documented on my portfolio.

I'm also going to try to be friendly, like everyone else at The Banff Centre! Here's a [wordle](http://www.wordle.net) I made to hang on my door. :)
