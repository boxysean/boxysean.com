My good friend Sarah Reynolds put together the third ever *[Lunch Beat LIC](http://www.facebook.com/LunchBeatLIC)* party this afternoon. I've been to every single one so far and they've all been a blast: food, nice people, and fun dancing. I really like the concept, too, on how it subverts New York lunch culture of eating quickly and running back to your desk to continue working.

This time, *Sarah invited [Reid](http://www.reidbingham.com) and I to bring the [Rainbow Machine](http://therainbowmachine.com/) to do a little light painting*. There wasn't enough space for our typical full setup, so instead we brought a mobile version [like the one I made this summer](http://blog.boxysean.com/2012/07/23/end-of-the-world-light-painting/).

Like the [last mechanism](http://blog.boxysean.com/images/end-of-the-world/web/rainbow-stick.jpg), this is just a thin piece of wood with LPD8806 RGB strip, an Arduino, and a 9V battery. The only difference is that we used two handles (made from bolts) instead of one. The space we were in[\*](http://www.secrettheatre.com/) was too small to twirl the stick around ([like this](http://blog.boxysean.com/images/end-of-the-world/web/0013.png)).

At first, I viewed putting two handles on the stick as a negative constraint. The one handle mechanism provided one degree of freedom to the light painter: twirl the stick, damnit!

But upon further thought, I became excited to try the second handle. *Two handles would allow the painter to dance with the stick*, to create abstract shapes that would bend and weave.

Here are the best photos from today!
