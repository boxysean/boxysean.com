A photobooth for the [9th Annual Flux Factory Art Auction](http://www.fluxfactory.org/fluxers/save-the-date-flux-not-so-silent-auction-2015/). We photographed subjects individually to create a series of photos that placed them with their fellow art auction attendees as though they were posing together for a group photo.

You can get a sense of the image placement algorithm with this GIF:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/images/fluxfinity/Fluxfinity-0017.jpg" />

<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/images/fluxfinity/Fluxfinity-0022.jpg" />

<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/images/fluxfinity/Fluxfinity-0037.jpg" />

<img src="{{ site.url }}/media/images/fluxfinity/Fluxfinity-0049.jpg" />

You get funny results when you have few photos!

We also did it for a Let's Face It Period event!
