A photobooth for the [Flux Factory Tenth Annual Silent Auction](http://www.fluxfactory.org/projects/flux-factorys-tenth-annual-auction/). We put a camera in the middle of the gallery and took 5 consecutive photographs of each participant, rotating the camera 2 degrees every shot. During the event, we had a computer that was regenerating a video that live-stitched the photos together to show the ever-growing result.
