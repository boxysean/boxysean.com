A photobooth that takes shots from 3 camera angles simultaneously and automatically stitches them together as an animated GIF. The photos are developed almost instantaneously for the viewer's immediate gratification.

Each camera is triggered by a Raspberry Pi and stitched together using some small scripts. See [my blog post](/blog/2014/01/19/fluxtime-photobooth/) for more information.
