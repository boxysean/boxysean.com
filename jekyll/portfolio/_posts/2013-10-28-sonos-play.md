Sonos Play was an experience best described as "IKEA meets James Turrell": a showroom full of minimal interactive light work showcasing the Sonos speakers. It was exhibited in New York and Los Angeles.

My role was producer on the fabrication end of things, leading the build and programming of the colorful steel-reinforced acrylic furniture.
