The Cube is a hanging pendant lamp made from wood and 96 light bulbs, each side measuring 1 foot. The Cube started off as "more than just a lamp", the first ones I made had lights that danced automatically, sometimes in time with music, and sometimes on a basic loop.

A key part of this design was a [Triac Fanout circuit board](https://github.com/boxysean/TriacFanout) I designed and fabricated to control AC voltage, dimming up to 8 channels from an Arduino-compatible microcontroller.

What I learned, however, was the Cube is "more than just a lamp", even without the complexity of dancing light bulbs. It looks great and has warmed every space it's been installed in, from an art gallery to my friends' living rooms.
