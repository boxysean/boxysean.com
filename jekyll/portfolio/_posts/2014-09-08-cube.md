The Cube is a hanging pendant lamp made from wood and 96 light bulbs, each side measuring 1 foot. The Cube is "more than just a lamp" because the lights dance automatically, sometimes reacting to music, and sometimes on a basic loop.

As I made more Cubes, I realized the Cube's form makes it "more than just a lamp", so I started making them without the dancing lights. It looks great and has warmed every space it's been installed in, from art galleries to music venues to my friends' living rooms.

A key part of this design was a [Triac Fanout circuit board](https://github.com/boxysean/TriacFanout) I designed and fabricated to control AC voltage, dimming up to 8 channels from an Arduino-compatible microcontroller.
