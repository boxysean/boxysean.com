The week of November 14, my collaborators and I hosted little WiFi networks on the L train between the Morgan and 8th Ave stops from 8-10 each morning.

The network served curated local literary arts, image media, news feed headlines, and had a chat feature. The intranet, served by a plug computer and a router, was carried by a team of 15 people we hired, and covered a few cars near the back of the train.

We released a [technical document](https://github.com/boxysean/LTrainNotwork/blob/master/techdoc.md) and [the code](https://github.com/boxysean/LTrainNotwork/) for our mobile web framework.
