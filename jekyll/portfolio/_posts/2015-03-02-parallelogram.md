The Parallelogram is a wall-mounted lamp containing 60 light bulbs. It was designed and built for the basement of [Trans-Pecos](https://www.thetranspecos.com/) while the space was curated by good friend [Stephanie Neptune](https://www.instagram.com/spacejamzzzz/), and is the spiritual descendant of the [Cube](/portfolio/cube/). The lamps provided a nice campfire glow to the space, creating a magical ambiance.
