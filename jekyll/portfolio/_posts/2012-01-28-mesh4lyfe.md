Mesh4LYFE consists of eight horizontally stacked routers to create a lo-res 8x4 display out of the router LEDs. The LEDs, which typically blink diagnostic information about each router, display [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

This project was conceived and made during [Art Hack Day](http://arthackday.net/319scholes/).

How it works
------------

Each router (Netgear WNDR3700v2) runs a small Linux distribution called [OpenWrt](http://www.openwrt.org). OpenWrt permits custom software on the routers and allows to control some of the routers LEDs directly.

Typically, wireless routers and wireless devices run a standard 802.11 protocol. The protocol dictates that wireless devices only communicate with the router.

Mesh4LYFE uses an alternative mesh protocol called [B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced](http://www.open-mesh.org/wiki/batman-adv). With this protocol, the devices communicate directly with each other and coordinate amongst themselves to send data to other devices in the network, either directly or by relaying along to devices in between.

Each router is individually responsible for computing the next generation Conway's Game of Life. How it works:

- A *neighbour* message is sent to each router to tell each router who its neighbours are.
- A *random* message is broadcast to initialize each router to a random state.
- An *update* message is broadcast to trigger each router to send its present state to its neighbours.
- Once a router receives its neighbours' state, it computes its next generation.
- A *display* message is broadcast to trigger each router to display its next generation.
- After a random number of generations, the routers are re-initialized with a *random* broadcast and the *update* and *display* process starts again.

The *update* and *display* messages are sent in lockstep with a delay after each message.
